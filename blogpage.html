        <h2>Who was Boadie?</h2>
        <p class="blogfont">
          Preston "Bodie" Broadus was a drug dealer for the Barksdale organization.  He started working in the pit under D'Angelo Barksdale.  He was a notoriously loyal soldier for the Barksdale organization.  He eventually advanced to a more prominent role within the organization.  Many fans often choose <a href="https://thewire.fandom.com/wiki/Omar_Devon_Little">Omar </a>as their favorite character.  Omar is definitely in my top five, but I personally prefer Bodie.  Here's why...

          Although Bodie was a drug dealer and killed his friend <a href="https://thewire.fandom.com/wiki/Wallace">Wallace</a>, I find his character very interesting.  His role paints him as easily angered and extremely violent when necessary.  This is possibly due to his upbringing and a product of the "The Game."  However, after some advice from <a href="https://thewire.fandom.com/wiki/Russell_Bell">"Stringer" Bell</a>, Bodie starts to think before acting. He is still fierce, but as "Stringer" Bell suggests, he shows some flex. His decisions become more calculated and watching this transition, coupled with his loyalty made me want him to succeed even more.  He isn't one of the main characters even though he appeared in almost every season, so it was really cool to see the slightest development of his character through the series.  Bodie stays true to who he is, but also develops respect for the police. He recognizes how each they almost need each other for "The Game."

          Unfortunately, Bodie had to die. One might argue that his willingness to "snitch" on Marlo and not on the Barksdale organization is hypicritical; he should have been killed for that reason. That may be true.  His character is still that of a soldier. He doesn't want out of the game, he wants Marlo to pay for his transgressions; for killing little Kevin specifically and all of the other indiscriminant executions.  Besides, I can't imagine Bodie snitching and being in protective custody. His Mother and Brother are dead.  His Grandmother and his Corner Crew are his family.  Where is he gonna go? Again, he's still a soldier; probably the best soldier in the Barksdale organization (who's name is not <a href="https://thewire.fandom.com/wiki/Roland_Brice">"Wee Bey.")</a>

          Next week (or whenever), we'll discuss the unspoken mentors who shapped Preston "Bodie" Broadus and the impact each had on his life.
